    <h4>Crisp, buttery, and oh so rich. What's not to love about Baklava?</h4>
    <p>
        Baklava is a traditional Middle Eastern and Mediterranian dessert made with several layers of phyllo pastry,
        chopped nuts, and a sweet syrup. There are many reigonal variations on this dish, but our recipe has a distinctly Turkish flair! 
        This specific recipe uses thirty layers of phyllo, fragrant pistachios, and a delicious orange blossom water syrup.

        This recipe is mostly assembly, but it still requires attention to detail. 
        Taking care with the small aspects such as maintaining the moisture of your phyllo, clarification of your butter, and cooling
         your syrup before you pour will make all the difference!

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
    <h3>Making the sugar syrup:</h3>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, water, glucose syrup (if using),
             lemon and salt, and bring to a full boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to ensure that the sugar dissolves. 
             Once boiled, take off heat and stir in the orange blossom water.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a measuring cup with a spout or gravy boat and set aside to cool completely before using. 
            (Cooled syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 4 days; bring back to room temperature before using)</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
    <h3>Preparing the pastry:</h3>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 F.</li>
        <li>Pulse pistachios in food processor until very finely chopped, 
            about fifteen 1-second pulses; transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Brush a 13x9 inch baking pan with ghee or clarified butter. 
            Unwrap and unfold phyllo on a large cutting board and smooth out with hands to flatten. Using the pan as a guide, adjust the size of the phyllo by cutting off excess to fit perfectly into the pan. 
            Cover phyllo with plastic wrap, then top with a damp kitchen towel to prevent drying.</li>
        <li>Place 1 sheet of phyllo in the bottom of the prepared pan and brush with the ghee or clarified butter until completely coated. 
            Layer 7 more sheets of phyllo into the pan, brushing each sheet with more ghee/butter. 
            You should now have a total of 8 layers of phyllo. Top with 1 cup of the ground pistachios and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Layer 6 more sheets of phyllo into the pan, brushing each layer with more ghee/clarified butter, then top with another 1 cup of pistachios. 
            Repeat with 6 more sheets of phyllo, more ghee/butter, and the remaining cup of pistachios.</li>
        <li>Layer the remaining 10 sheets of phyllo into the pan using the nicest, most intact sheets, brushing each layer, except the final layer, with more ghee/ clarified butter. 
            Working from the center outward, use the palm of your hands to compress the layers and press out any air pockets. 
            Use a sharp knife to cut the baklava into diamonds; 5 cuts vertically and about 8 cuts diagonally. 
            Brush the remaining ghee/clarified butter over the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake the baklava until golden and crisp, about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours, rotating the pan halfway through baking.</li>
        <li>Immediately after removing the baklava from oven, pour the cooled syrup over cut lines until about 2 tablespoons remain (syrup will sizzle when it hits hot pan); 
            drizzle remaining syrup over the surface. Garnish center of each piece with pinch of ground pistachios.</li>
        <li>Cool to room temperature on wire rack, about 3 hours, then cover with foil and let stand at least 8 hours before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
