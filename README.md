This is my first HTML project created while following The Odin Project's Foundations course, showcasing the the introductory skills I've learned thus far. As a prerequisite to completing this project I established a basic workflow from the Command Line using Git and GitHub, making use of atomic commits and appropriate commit messages. This project's primary purpose is to demonstrate my abilities to utilize various HTML elements such as lists, links, images, and text formatting.
